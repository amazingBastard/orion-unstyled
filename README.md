# Unstyled Orion Admin Theme

This is the unstyled version of the Orion Admin Theme. This theme is a replica of the ```orionjs:bootstrap``` package
except with bootstrap markup removed and most of the class names changed. This package is for orion developers that would prefer to write their own css without any framework dependencies.

## Installation

While in your meteor app's root, run the following from the command line:

```
$ meteor add dvz:orion-unstyled
```

## Package Details

This package does not need any framework dependencies. It should add ```useraccounts:unstyled``` so you would need to style your login page as well. Since Summernote relies on bootstrap, you would need to use ```orionjs:froala```.

## Roadmap

Planning on working on creating an unstyled version of autoform without boostrap class names.
